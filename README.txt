This Java command line application controls and monitors Blue Iris security camera system. 
As a Java app it can run on Linux, Windos or Mac.

This project started as Java port of blueiriscmd Python software written by Magnus Appelquist
(https://github.com/magapp/blueiriscmd). For a reference, Python 3.8 version is in doc/python directory.

The current version 1.2.18 of blueiriscmdj has been extended, and covers all BlueIris API commands 
as defined in House Logix document - https://www.houselogix.com/docs/blue-iris/BlueIris/json.htm.

All Java Classes have coresponding unit tests. For the tests to work, 
you need a BI system with at least one camera.

For more information look at https://github.com/jurek1oo/blueiriscmdj/wiki.  

Have fun and let me know if you have any issues.

Good luck,
