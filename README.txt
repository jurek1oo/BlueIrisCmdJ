This is Java port of blueiriscmd Python software written by Magnus Appelquist (https://github.com/magapp/blueiriscmd). 
I have used Python code as the template, and have upgraded the code to run on Python 3.8.
For the reference, Python version is in doc/python directory.

As from version 1.2.00 blueiriscmdj diverted from original blueiriscmd. Command line naming convention changed and additional functionality was added. All Classes have coresponding tests.

For full list of cnd line commands have a look at Github [wiki](Command-Line-Arguments).  


For the unit tests to work, you need to change the login and other system parameters, in Constants4Tests class.

For more blueiriscmdj information, check the project wiki.

Have fun and let me know if you have issues.

Good luck,
